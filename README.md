# Python Projects – CLI, GUI (Tkinter), and Web (Flask)

This repository contains a collection of 9 projects developed using Python, with variations in user interface: Command Line (CLI), Desktop GUI using Tkinter, and Web app using Flask.
Each application has been built in three formats to explore how a single idea can be implemented across different platforms.

 ## Projects Overview
 
 ### 1. Quiz App
 
Python (CLI): A simple terminal-based quiz where users answer multiple-choice questions.

Tkinter: A GUI version with buttons, labels, and score display.

Flask: A web-based quiz app with HTML forms and score tracking.

### 2. To-Do List App

Python (CLI): Manage your tasks via the terminal – add, delete, and view tasks.

Tkinter: A user-friendly GUI to manage tasks with buttons and listboxes.

Flask: A web version to create, complete, and delete tasks from a browser.

### 3. Weather App

Python (CLI): Fetches current weather data from an API and displays it in the terminal.

Tkinter: A GUI that takes city input and shows real-time weather details.

Flask: A web app where users can search for weather information using a clean interface.

### Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language

Tkinter – For desktop GUI applications

Flask – For building lightweight web apps

REST APIs – Used in Weather apps for live data

### ✅ Purpose
This collection demonstrates how the same project idea can be implemented across different platforms, helping to understand UI/UX considerations and backend logic in varied contexts.
